# SAM in Trucking IoT on HDF

## Introduction

This tutorial covers the core concepts of Streaming Analytics Manager (SAM) and the role it plays in an environment in which Stream processing is important.

We will create a SAM topology to ingest streams of data from Apache Kafka into our stream application, do some complex processing and store the data into Druid and HDFS.

## Prerequisites

- Downloaded and deployed the [Hortonworks DataFlow (HDF)](https://www.cloudera.com/downloads/hortonworks-sandbox/hdf.html?utm_source=mktg-tutorial) Sandbox

## Outline

- [Stream Processing & SAM](https://hortonworks.com/tutorial/sam-in-trucking-iot-on-hdf/section/1/)- You will learn the fundamental concepts of Stream Processing and SAM.
- [Create a SAM Topology](https://hortonworks.com/tutorial/sam-in-trucking-iot-on-hdf/section/2/)- You will learn to build a stream processing application

## Tutorial Reference Application

This tutorial series uses our **[Trucking IoT Application](https://github.com/orendain/trucking-iot/tree/hadoop-summit-2017)** comprised of multiple sub-projects. You will build the SAM topology application su-bproject.
