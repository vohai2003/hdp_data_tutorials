# Storm in Trucking IoT on HDF

## Introduction

This tutorial will cover the core concepts of Storm and the role it plays in an environment where real-time, low-latency and distributed data processing is important.

We will build a Storm topology from the ground up and demonstrate a full data pipeline, from Internet of Things (IoT) data ingestion from the edge, to data processing with Storm, to persisting this data and viewing it in a visualization web application.

## Prerequisites

- Downloaded and deployed the [Hortonworks DataFlow (HDF)](https://www.cloudera.com/downloads/hortonworks-sandbox/hdf.html?utm_source=mktg-tutorial) Sandbox

## Outline

- [Trucking IoT Use Case](https://hortonworks.com/tutorial/storm-in-trucking-iot-on-hdf/section/1/) - Discuss a real-world use case and understand the role Storm plays within in.
- [Running the Demo](https://hortonworks.com/tutorial/storm-in-trucking-iot-on-hdf/section/2/) - Walk through the demo and first gain an understanding of the data pipeline.
- [Building a Storm Topology](https://hortonworks.com/tutorial/storm-in-trucking-iot-on-hdf/section/3/) - Dive into Storm internals and build a topology from scratch.
- [Deploying the Topology](https://hortonworks.com/tutorial/storm-in-trucking-iot-on-hdf/section/4/) - Package the Storm code and deploy onto your cluster.
