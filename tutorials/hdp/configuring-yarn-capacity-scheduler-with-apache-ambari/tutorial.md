# Configuring Yarn Capacity Scheduler with Apache Ambari

## Introduction

In this tutorial we will explore how we can configure YARN Capacity Scheduler from Ambari.

YARN's Capacity Scheduler is designed to run Hadoop applications in a shared, multi-tenant cluster while maximizing the throughput and the utilization of the cluster.

Traditionally each organization has it own private set of compute resources that have sufficient capacity to meet the organization's SLA. This generally leads to poor average utilization. Additionally, there is heavy overhead of managing multiple independent clusters.

Sharing clusters between organizations allows economies of scale. However, organizations are concerned about sharing a cluster in the fear of not getting enough available resources that are critical to meet their SLAs.

The Capacity Scheduler is designed to allow sharing a large cluster while giving each organization capacity guarantees. There is an added benefit that an organization can access any excess capacity not being used by others. This provides elasticity for the organizations in a cost-effective manner.

Sharing clusters across organizations necessitates strong support for multi-tenancy since each organization must be guaranteed capacity and safeguards to ensure the shared cluster is impervious to single rogue application or user or sets thereof. The Capacity Scheduler provides a stringent set of limits to ensure that a single application or user or queue cannot consume disproportionate amount of resources in the cluster. Also, the Capacity Scheduler provides limits on initialized/pending applications from a single user and queue to ensure fairness and stability of the cluster.

The primary abstraction provided by the Capacity Scheduler is the concept of queues. These queues are typically set up by administrators to reflect the economics of the shared cluster.

To provide further control and predictability on sharing of resources, the Capacity Scheduler supports hierarchical queues to ensure resources are shared among the sub-queues of an organization before other queues are allowed to use free resources, thereby providing affinity for sharing free resources among applications of a given organization.

## Prerequisites

## Configuring the Capacity Scheduler

After you spin up the Hortonworks Sandbox, login to Ambari. The Username/Password credentials are **raj_ops/raj_ops**.

![ambari_login](assets/ambari-login.jpg)

After you Login, you will see the Dashboard. This is a unified view of the state of your Sandbox.

![ambari_dashboard_rajops](assets/ambari-dashboard-rajops.jpg)

You can drill into a specific service dashboard and configuration.
Let’s dive into YARN dashboard by selecting **Yarn** from the left-side bar or the drop down menu.

![select_yarn](assets/select-yarn.jpg)

We will start updating the configuration for Yarn Capacity Scheduling policies. Click on **Configs** tab and click on **Advanced**.

![select_configs_tab](assets/select-configs-tab.jpg)

Next, scroll down to the **Scheduler** section of the page. The default capacity scheduling policy just has one queue which is **default**.

![capacity_scheduler_section](assets/capacity-scheduler-section.jpg)

Let's check out the scheduling policy visually. Scroll up to the top of the page click on **SUMMARY** and then select **ResourceManager UI** from the Quick Links section.

![quicklinks](assets/quicklinks.jpg)

Once in ResourceManager UI select **Queues**, you will see a visual representation of the Scheduler Queue and resources allocated to it.

## Adjust the scheduling policy for different departments

Let’s change the capacity scheduling policy to where we have separate queues and policies for Engineering, Marketing and Support.

Return to YARN Advanced Configs to adjust the Scheduler by navigating to **Ambari Dashboard>YARN>Configs>Advanced>Scheduler**

Replace the content for the configurations shown below in the **Capacity Scheduler** textbox:

![copy_paste_policy](assets/copy-paste-policy.jpg)

Click **Save** and confirm on the dialog box:

![popup](assets/popup.jpg)

~~~text
Changed Capacity Scheduler Config.
~~~

In the next two windows that appear click **Ok** and **Proceed Anyway**, next you will find a confirmation window select **REFRESH YARN QUEUES**

![refresh-queues](assets/refresh-queues.jpg)

At this point, the configuration is saved but we still need to restart the affected components by the configuration change as indicated in the orange band below:

![restart_needed](assets/restart-needed.jpg)

Also note that there is now a new version of the configuration as indicated by the green **Current** label.

Let’s restart the daemons by clicking on the three dots `...` next to **Services** under the Ambari Stack. Select **Restart All Affected** and wait for the restart to complete.

![restart_yarn_progress](assets/restart-all.jpg)

and then go back to the Resource Manager UI  and refresh the page. Voila! There’s our new policy:

![resource_manager_ui_new_policy](assets/ui-new-policy.jpg)

## Rolling back configuration setting

You can also rollback to the previous set of configurations.

Return to Ambari Dashboard then select Config History and select YARN:

![yarnhistory](assets/yarn-history.jpg)

Finally, select **Make Current** and re-start services one last time.

## Summary

In this tutorial, you learned how to configure different queues and allotment of resources to those queues. Hope this brief tour of using YARN's Capacity Scheduler gave you some ideas on how to achieve better utilization of Hadoop clusters.
