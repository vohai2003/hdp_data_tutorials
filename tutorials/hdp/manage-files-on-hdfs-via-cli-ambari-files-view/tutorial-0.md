# Manage Files on HDFS via Cli/Ambari Files View

## Introduction

The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is a sub-project of the Apache Hadoop project. It is highly fault-tolerant and is designed to be deployed on low-cost hardware. It also provides high throughput access to application data and is suitable for applications that have large data sets.

This tutorial walks through commonly used commands to manage files through the command line interface (CLI) and web-based interface (Files View).
